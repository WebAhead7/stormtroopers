    2: Navbar menu, created using flexbox for better responsiveness, (flexwrap, display none and JS toggle).
    1: Contact us section. inside the contact us section i created 3 <div> elements. added flex-grow, basis and shrink. 
    left one has a bg of darth vader, center has the contact us form and the right one is empty element added to keep balance.

    ِAWWAD:
    MY WORK SECTION
    I worked on the Team Members section. This section has another three small sections inside, Basically I used flexbox in the main
    section to arrange each member section in one     column, and inside each member section I used flexbox too to arrannge the inner
    information about the member.

    ISSUES/CHALLENGES IN MY CODE
    In the main section, I wanted to put a background image with low opacity and to look exactly under the session, but didnt find a way
    to do it with the background image --> so I created another div in the main which contains the wanted background image, I positioned
    it absolute to the main section with top right bottom left 0, and with small opacity. I used z-index:3 for the main section so we can
    see the background (actually the div) under the main session.
